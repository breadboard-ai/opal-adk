# Opal ADK

The Opal ADK project is complementary to the Breadboard open source project.
Opal ADK seeks to create a backend execution environment for Breadboard
generated app graphs.

As the name suggests the backend will be agentic in nature with the goal of
creating a workflow of ADK agents to represent the Breadboard graph.  Creating
the workflow in an entirely agentic way will allow for easy exports of 
Breadboard apps, scheduling and triggering of executions and will allow for
expansion with new agentic behavior as it becomes available in the widely used
ADK framework.
